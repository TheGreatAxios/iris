# Iris

## Overview
Iris is known as the messenger of the Olympian Gods in Greek History. Additionally, it is floating around in the SKALEVerse somewhere near Jupiter... 

## Idea
While on-chain messaging normally would be very expensive; SKALE offers the ability to make it happen. Additionally, the multi-network setup offers a unique option to offer on-chain messaging from dApps to users that can be picked up by a single router. 

This happens by offering a core messaging contract where an individual can "register" and then send messages to any other address. The way the IMA bridge is built means on a custom contract could be used and registered via the IMA bridge to offer updates directly on chain in the form of a message. 

Two Types of Messages

- Messages -> Private Message from one EOA to another
- Notice -> Allow smart contracts to send notices to users
